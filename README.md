# GmailWrapped
A dashboard that uses probabilistic modeling + NLP to create actionable insights on your mailing behavior, characterize your most successful cold emails, and help you replicate/map/scale that success. 

In the same fashion as Spotify Wrapped, we'll display visualizations that give you a monthly breakdown of email activity + success. Around when were you most active? What weeks had a bit of a 'lull', and are there any reasons why? 

It'll show you what kinds of emails got the highest and fastest response rates and compare that across features like the time of email sent, day of week, holiday/weekend vs weekday, and character length. Sentiment analysis is used to figure out 1) what type of writing style has the highest success and 2) figure out which emails were 'successful' (aka responder was enthusiastic, fulfilled your request, wants to give you the job). 

More coming soon!
